 
ABOUT PHIDGETS

The encoders.py code is a python ROS node that interfaces with the Phidget
encoders device. In order to run this code, libphidget21 and the python wrapper
must be installed, and certain permissions must be set:

- libphidget21
Download the library from http://www.phidgets.com/drivers.php (i.e. the linux
source package). Unpack it to a directory of your choice and cd into that
directory. Then type:
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
If that does not work: RTFM

- permissions
In order to enable non-root access to the Phidget, udev must be configured to
give r/w access to the port. From the libphidget21 directory
  sudo cp udev/99-phidgets.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
  sudo restart udev

- python wrapper
Download the python module from
http://www.phidgets.com/programming_resources.php
Unpack the archive to a directory of your choice and cd into that directory.
Then type:
  python setup.py build
  sudo python setup.py install
If that does not work: RTFM



ABOUT ARDUINO

The code in the arduino repository is meant to be uploaded to the arduino
platform. It allows to interface the Arduino with ROS.

- installation of the Arduino IDE
(Tested with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.10, but should work with older
releases.)
  * download and install the latest release from
    http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software
  * install the compiler (gcc-avr) and the libraries (avr-libc) packages:
    sudo apt-get install gcc-avr avr-libc
  * if you use the USB port to dialog, you should add yourself to the group
    'dialout' in order to have write permissions on that port:
    sudo usermod -aG dialout <myuser>

- testing
  * roscore
  * rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py /dev/ttyACM0
  * rostopic pub /steer_angle std_msgs/Float64 20
