Below is a description of how to use this MODT package for object detection;

1. to generate raw training data, use "ST_GenRawTrainingData"
2. label the raw training data to get a mask summary of LIDAR scans, for certain ros databag, use "ST_LabelRawTrainingData"
   "DATMO_Label_Parameters.yaml" is used to give some parameters;
   The output file is "abstract_summary.yaml"
3. Based on the summary file of scan masks, generate derived training data, using "spatial_temporal_segmentation" by setting the program mode to "0";
4. Use the derived data to train you svm classifer;
	Format the data using "./bin/DATMO_dataformatting", remember to change the sample number;
	./svm-scale -s data/range_9_4 data/9_4formatted > data/scaled_9_4
	 python tools/grid.py data/scaled_9_4
	./svm-train -s 0 -c 32 -g 0.5 -e 0.1 data/scaled_9_4
5. Run the detection online using "spatial_temporal_segmentation" by setting the program mode to "1";
