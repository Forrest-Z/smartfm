When attempting to connect to several USB cameras at the same time, we run into
the VIDIOC_STREAMON problem:
   libv4l2: error turning on stream: No space left on device
   VIDIOC_STREAMON: No space left on device

It happens when the cams are on the same bus.



grabcam.cpp opens one cam and displays its image. Attempting to launch it twice
in different process triggers the VIDIOC_STREAMON problem.

multicam.cpp grabs an image from a camera, then an image from the other camera
and so on. It still triggers the VIDIOC_STREAMON problem.

multicamclose.cpp does the same as multicam.cpp, except that it opens the camera,
grabs the frame and closes the camera each time. As a result, it does not trigger
the VIDIOC_STREAMON problem, but frame rate is quite slow (1-2 fps). Besides,
the white balance mechanism does not work anymore.
