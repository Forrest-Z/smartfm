The main launch file to this package is the localization_sim.launch. In this
launch file, amcl, lolization_error and map_server processes are initialized.
The localization_error is a simple program that listen to synchronised
/base_pose_ground_truth and amcl_pose messages to calculate the error and
print the output to the terminal.

single_sim.sh runs this particular launch file and output 2 log files: detailed
and summary logs from the simulated localization. The log files are located at
map_simplification/log.

start_sim_multi.sh enables multiple processes of single_sim.sh running in
parallel. It also generate the map configuration files needed to load the
correct map by localization_sim.launch.

map_simplification/maps/comb contains all the possible combination of maps
generated by map_simplification/bin/map_generate.

To start a very short but comprehensive simulation run, change the parameters of
start_sim_multi.sh to thread_n=2 and total_it=1, where 2 simulations will run
in parallel by running a pre-recorded bag data files produced from Stage.
The bag file currently in used is map_simplification/2_filtered_clock.bag.
After finished running the simulation, you may take a look at the log files
produced at map_simplification/log/summary.csv.
