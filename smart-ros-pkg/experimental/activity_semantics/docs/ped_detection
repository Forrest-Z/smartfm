b. Framework of "data_assoc.cpp"
	---> 3 inputs: 1) raw image; 2) "pedestrian_roi" from vision pedestrian detection; 3) "pedestrian_clusters" from laser clustering;	
	---> Main functions:
		(@_@) pedVisionAngularCallback: to update the belief of tracked objects, paralelly from laser related processes;
		(@_@) pedClustCallback: containing the following functions:
			(1) updatelPedInViewWithNewCluster(): cluster to update ped tracks; 
			    	-> each track searches for its nearest input cluster; 
				-> if distance smaller than Threshold, the track is updated;
			(2) updateMergeList(): check the mergelist (recording the list of merged tracks);
				-> check if more than two tracks (in one group) are updated, if so, erase the updated tracks from the group;
				-> for the groups in the merge-list with one track updated, this track is also used to update other tracks;
			(3) checkMergedlPedInView(): check two updated tracks, wheter they should be merged; 
				-> if so, the pairing information is stored in the merge list;
			(4) add any remaining clusters as new lPedInView;
			(5) updateImageHash():
				-> update the compressed image information of unmerged tracks;
			(6) cleanUp(): delete obsolete tracks;
			(7) publishPed(): publish various information of the tracked pedestrians;
