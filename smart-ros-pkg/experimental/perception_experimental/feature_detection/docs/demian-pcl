Problem happens with pcl1.5 about EuclideanClusterExtraction; segmentation fault happens sometimes with the "extract" function;

Demian's solution:
Alright, so it seems to be working. Here's what I changed:
- installed perception-pcl-unstable: sudo apt-get install ros-fuerte-perception-pcl-fuerte-unstable 
- changed dependency from pcl to pcl16 at manifest.xml
- removed octomap depency from manifest.xml (Octomap is compiled against pcl1.5)
- changed all the pcl's header and function to pcl16
- removed all octomap related functions
