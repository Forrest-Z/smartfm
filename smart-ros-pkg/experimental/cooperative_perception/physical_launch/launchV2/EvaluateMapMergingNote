The evaluation was done by the following steps:
1. clean up all the tf from 3 seperate bag files
2. Perform localization on all the bag files to obtain ground truth
3. Combine into one bag files, RViz should be able to show a nice
   output of all sensor streams with high accuracy
4. Perform vehicle detection and disable tf broadcast
   (Can be improved by renaming correct tf, right now it is taken
    care by the mapOptimizer.launch)
   Example: rosbag/20131205_coop/5pm_clean_bag/all_in_one_vehicle_detect.bag
5. roscd cooperative_perception/physical_launch/launchV2/
