 * at the t-junction the car can check the infrastructure sensor if it's up
 * and running, and it also uses the interactive marker on rviz for human
 * feedback. At EA and E3A, it uses the onboard cameras, etc.
 *
 * Each behavior is implemented by an IntersectionPolicy object. The
 * IntersectionHandler is in charge of launching the relevant policies and
 * taking the final decision.
