/** A class to handle going through intersections.
 *
 * Some intersections are equipped with an infrastructure sensor that tells the
 * car whether it is safe to go through. For some other intersections, the
 * passenger is required to give the clear to go signal by clicking on rviz.
 *
 * For now there is only one intersection with an infrastructure sensor. This
 * is currently identified by location (i.e. by comparing the global position
 * with some hard-coded value). Since this is still experimental, we keep the
 * manual signal in parallel: the passenger can click on rviz to give the clear
 * to go signal and override the infrastructure sensor signal.
