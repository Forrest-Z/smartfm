This document details the procedure to install ros in a linux environment and
work with the code for the autonomous golfcart.

Overview
=======

We use Robot Operating System (ros - www.ros.org/wiki) for development on the
golfcart. It is set of algorithms and drivers for robots along with a 
communications framework to enable easy development of software typically
required for robots, like localization, motion-planning, perception etc. It also
consists of a number of packages for simulation and visualization. We use
the "fuerte" version of ros for our development.

The following guide assumes Ubuntu 12.04 (LTS) as the development system.
Guidelines for other linux distributions differ only in step 1. It is possible
(though not recommended) to use ros under Mac Os, more information can be found
at http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/OSX/Homebrew/Source .

Requirements
============

1.  Install the desktop-full version of fuerte using guidelines from
    http://www.ros.org/wiki/fuerte/Installation/Ubuntu

2.  Checkout a version of the golfcar code base using the command
    "git clone nissan@ares.lids.mit.edu:/home/git/smartfm.git"

3.  Add the following line to the end of ~/.bashrc
    "export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=/home/code/smartfm:$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH"
    where "/home/code/smartfm" is the location of the repository
    checked out in step 2.

Procedure
=========

1.  Run
    "rospack profile"
    to profile all available packages (in particular the smartfm repository)

2.  The following commands can be used to build the RRT* simulation
    a.  Build packages rrts, golfcar_ppc, map_server_ext, speed_advisor, 
        e,g, "rosmake rrts"
    b.  Launch main simulation 
        "roslaunch local_map_ext simulation.launch"
    c.  Launch packages rrts, golfcar_ppc, speed_advisor as follows,
        "rosrun rrts rrts_node"
        "rosrun golfcar_ppc golfcar_pp"
        "rosrun speed_advisor speed_advisor"
    d.  Launch visualizer as follows
        "roscd local_map_ext"
        "rosrun rviz rviz -d rvizconfig.vcg"
    e.  Click on "2D Nav Goal" button in Rviz to give a goal to the golfcar
